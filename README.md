# cycloid-racer

> 학교 축제를 위해 만든 그저 그런 그림 그리기 챌린지.

- Draw the perfect cycloid and roll the ball fastest to win!
- Built for use on large touch devices, great for use in science fair booths
- Powered by matter.js, the rigid body simulator for the web
- Leaderboard functionality adds in competition

Notes
- This *toy* project has typical properties of a web-based mini-game built by high-schoolers: Thousands of lines of spaghetti code, unrecognizable variable names, code blocks reused everywhere via ctrl-c; I know it's terrible, but still I have no will to fix it of now.
- This repository is for archiving purposes only. Anyone can use the code here if they want to (probably not), but I'm currently not interesting in making improvements here.
